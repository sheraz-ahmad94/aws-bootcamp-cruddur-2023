# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Live Stream

Watched the live stream and followed the instructions. 
I opened the project in gitpod, added docker files in both - backend and frontend, set up the variables and ran the docker compose command. Committed the code and moved on.

## Notifications Functionality
Next I followed along the notification implementation video. I followed the instructions in the video and implemented without any difficulty. Except a couple of typos here and there. Committed the code and onwards.
