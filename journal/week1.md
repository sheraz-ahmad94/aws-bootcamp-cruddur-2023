# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Live Stream

Watched the live stream and followed the instructions. 
I opened the project in gitpod, added docker files in both - backend and frontend, set up the variables and ran the docker compose command. Committed the code and moved on.

## Notifications Functionality
Next I followed along the notification implementation video. I followed the instructions in the video and implemented without any difficulty. Except a couple of typos here and there. Committed the code and onwards.

## Installing Postgres and DynamoDB Containers
Last set of tasks for this week were installing DynamoDB container and Postgres Container.
Following along the instructions provided in the video, I was able to implement both containers in the project. Added the relevent code in Docker Compose file and gitpod yaml file. And then executed the `psql -h localhost` to test the successful installation of Postgres

## Challenges Faced During the Work
It was mostly copy/paste work. The real difficulty / confusion was, WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH THE COMMANDS WE RAN? I tried looking them on my own - understood some, some went above my head.

## Learnings
So, I was always scared of docker/containerization. I try my best to avoid it. But getting hands on training with a proper instructor and a couple of professionals in the field made it look very easy. After getting a little taste of it, I am not scared of it anymore and gonna learn it properly so that I can integrate it in my workflow. 

DynamoDB was something new for me. It has more work to it in the weeks to come. So, looking forward to it.

I have interacted with postgres on and off in past. And excited about what's to come in the project in later weeks.
