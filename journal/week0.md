## Challenges

Here is my journal for the week 0 challenges and what I did about them.

## Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, IAM role
> Setting Up MFA
- Logged in using the Amazon AWS login page and went to Security Credentials in the top right corner.
- Next, Clicked on Assign MFA Device and added MFA to my root account using the Google Authenticator App on my Phone
- Now, every time I try to login to my account, it asks for the code from my Auth App
